 ## Building

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/PGG106/Alexandria
$ cd alexandria
$ make 
$ ./Alexandria
```
 ## How to use the engine

The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard protocol used to communicate with
a chess engine, and is the recommended way to do so for typical graphical user interfaces
(GUI) or chess tools. Alexandria implements the majority of its options as described
in [the UCI protocol](https://www.shredderchess.com/download/div/uci.zip).

## Participating in the project

Alexandria's improvement is a time consuming effort and any help is extremely appreciated. 
If you like the project and what to help it out the following are the preferred ways to do so, please read the next section very carefully.

### Donating hardware

If you want to donate hardware that will go towards testing patches for the engine, you can donate
your hardware resources by getting a client file for [OpenBench](https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench)
and creating a profile on alexandria's OB instance [here](https://chess.swehosting.se/).

### Improving the code
Alexandria is open to external PRs and code contributions are highly encouraged and appreciated, just abide by a few rules:
#### Issues
1) before starting to work on a PR that fixes an issue with the engine open an issue in the repository first, from that we'll be able to discuss on who will handle the issue and 
what is the best way to proceed in fixing it.
#### Bench altering commits (anything that is functional and changes bench)
1) Please make sure your idea makes sense from a chess engine development point of view, no single position analysis nor bizarre chess theories that only apply to humans.
2) If possible ensure your change passes a SPRT before making the PR, if not create a test on alexandria's OB instance and i'll judge whether i can spare the resources to run it.
